Overview

Artificial neural network architecture includes feedforward neural networks, also referred to as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Information moves in a feedforward network in a single direction, from the input layer to the output layer via one or more hidden layers, without creating loops or cycles. The word "feedforward" comes from this forward flow of information.

The main elements and traits of feedforward networks are as follows:

Layers:

- Input Layer: The network's initial layer, where input data is first introduced.
The layers that lie in between the input and output layers are known as hidden layers. The word "hidden" describes the fact that each layer is made up of nodes, or neurons, and that neither the final output nor any direct interaction with the outside world occurs in these layers.
- Output Layer: The last layer that generates the output of the network.

1. Neurons (Nodes): Every node in the network is an information-processing computational unit.
Features of the input data are represented by nodes in the input layer.
Nodes in hidden layers apply activation functions and carry out calculations using weighted inputs from the preceding layer.
The network's final output is generated by nodes in the output layer.

2. Connections (Weights): The weights assigned to each connection between nodes indicate the connection's strength.
Throughout the training phase, weights are changed to allow the network to learn from data.

3. Activation Functions: To add non-linearities to the network and help it understand intricate relationships in the data, neurons in the hidden layers generally use activation functions.
Sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent (tanh), and rectified linear unit (ReLU) are examples of common activation functions.

4. Training: Supervised learning is used to train forward networks so they can map input data to desired output labels.
Using backpropagation, the network modifies its weights during training in order to minimize the discrepancy between expected and actual outputs (loss or error).

Because of their versatility and successful application to a range of tasks, feedforward networks
